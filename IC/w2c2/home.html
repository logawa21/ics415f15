    <h1>Welcome to Permanent Addiction</h1>

    <p>Did you know, that about 90% of adults and children are addicted to caffine? Well it's
      true!</p>

    <h2>What do you know about coffee?</h2>

    <p>Coffee is the one of the most addicting legal drug that can be found in a lot of things. It
      can be found in painkillers, green tea, and even chocolate. The average person who buys coffee
      outside of their home and work spend about the equivalent value of a round plane trip to
      Florida every year. It takes about 5 years before the coffee berries are ready to pick and one
      tree is the equivalent of one pound of roasted coffee!</p>

    <p>Coffee was first discovered in Ethiopia when they noticed their goats “dancing” after
      eating coffee berries. At first in Africa, people ate coffee berries with fat that were like
      energy balls. In 1675, the King of England banned coffee because the believed that, that was
      were people went to conspire against him. The only state that grows coffee in the United
      States is Hawaii and is the second most traded commodity (right after oil) in the world. The
      beans (after peeled out of the red berry) are roasted for a few minutes then pop and double in
      size. After it pops a second time, the beans are done, kind of like popcorn.</p>
